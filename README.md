# 🐍 Mini Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of simple Python projects! These are beginner-friendly mini projects that helped me practice core Python concepts like conditional statements, loops, functions, random module, and user interaction.

## 🧠 Projects Included

### 1. 🎯 Number Guessing Game
A fun terminal-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The program gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

- **Concepts used**: `random`, `while loop`, `if-else`, user input

### 2. 🔐 Password Generator
This script generates a strong, random password based on the user's choice of length and character types (letters, digits, symbols).

- **Concepts used**: `string`, `random`, `for loop`, user-defined functions

### 3. 🐍 Snake Water Stick Game
A Python version of the classic game "Snake, Water, Stick" (similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors). The player plays against the computer and the winner is decided based on game rules.

- **Concepts used**: `random.choice`, conditionals, loops, functions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Built-in modules only (`random`, `string`)
